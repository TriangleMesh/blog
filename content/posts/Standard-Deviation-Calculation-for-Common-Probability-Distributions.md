## 1. Binomial Distribution

### Definition:

The binomial distribution applies to independent repeated trials where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure). Let the probability of success in each trial be \( p \), the probability of failure be \( 1 - p \), and the number of trials be \( n \).

### Standard Deviation Formula:

$$
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)}
\]
$$

### Explanation:

- \( n \): The number of trials.
- \( p \): The probability of success.
- \( 1 - p \): The probability of failure.

### Example:

Suppose you toss a fair coin \( n \) times and calculate the standard deviation for the number of heads (success).

- \( n = 10 \)
- \( p = 0.5 \)
- \( 1 - p = 0.5 \)

**Calculation:**

$$
\
\sigma = \sqrt{10 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5} = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.58
\
$$

## 2. Hypergeometric Distribution

### Definition:

The hypergeometric distribution describes sampling without replacement from a finite population. The population size is \( N \), where \( K \) items are considered successes (e.g., red balls), and the remaining \( N - K \) are failures (e.g., blue balls). A sample of \( n \) is drawn, and we focus on the number of successes in the sample.

### Standard Deviation Formula:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot \frac{K}{N} \cdot \frac{N - K}{N} \cdot \frac{N - n}{N - 1}}
\]

### Explanation:

- \( N \): The population size.
- \( K \): The number of successes.
- \( n \): The sample size.

### Example:

Suppose there are \( N = 20 \) balls, of which \( K = 5 \) are red, and the remaining are blue. You draw \( n = 4 \) balls. The standard deviation of the number of red balls in the sample is:

**Calculation:**

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{4 \cdot \frac{5}{20} \cdot \frac{15}{20} \cdot \frac{16}{19}} \approx 0.87
\]

## 3. Normal Distribution

### Definition:

The normal distribution is a key continuous probability distribution, and many natural phenomena approximately follow it. The standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean.

### Standard Deviation Formula for Sample Data:

\\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}\\



### Explanation:

- \( x_i \): The \( i \)-th data point.
- \( \mu \): The mean of the data.
- \( n \): The number of data points.

### Example:

Suppose you have a set of measurements: \( x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 3, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 5 \).

**Mean Calculation:**

\[
\mu = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{5} = 3
\]

**Standard Deviation Calculation:**

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2}{5}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41
\]

## 4. Poisson Distribution

### Definition:

The Poisson distribution is used to describe the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, with the parameter \( \lambda \), which represents the average number of occurrences.

### Standard Deviation Formula:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}
\]

### Explanation:

- \( \lambda \): The average number of occurrences.

### Example:

If a store receives an average of \( \lambda = 5 \) customers per hour, the standard deviation for the number of customers is:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.24
\]

---

## 5. Geometric Distribution

### Definition:

The geometric distribution describes the number of failures before the first success, with the probability of success \( p \).

### Standard Deviation Formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{1 - p}}{p}
\]

### Explanation:

- \( p \): The probability of success.

### Example:

If the probability of making a successful basketball shot is \( p = 0.3 \), the standard deviation for the number of attempts before the first success is:

\[
\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{1 - 0.3}}{0.3} \approx 2.19
\]

---

## 6. Uniform Distribution

### Definition:

In a uniform distribution, all values within a certain range are equally likely to occur. Suppose a random variable \( X \) is uniformly distributed over the interval \([a, b]\).

### Standard Deviation Formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{b - a}{\sqrt{12}}
\]

### Explanation:

- \( a, b \): The lower and upper limits of the interval.

### Example:

If a random variable is uniformly distributed between \( 0 \) and \( 10 \), the standard deviation is:

\[
\sigma = \frac{10 - 0}{\sqrt{12}} \approx 2.89
\]

---

## 7. Exponential Distribution

### Definition:

The exponential distribution describes the time between events, with the parameter \( \lambda \), representing the rate of occurrence.

### Standard Deviation Formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{1}{\lambda}
\]

### Explanation:

- \( \lambda \): The rate of occurrence.

### Example:

If a device fails on average \( \lambda = 2 \) times per hour, the standard deviation of the time between failures is:

\[
\sigma = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

---

## Conclusion

The standard deviation plays a crucial role in statistics and probability theory by measuring the dispersion of data. The methods for calculating standard deviation vary depending on the type of distribution:

- **Discrete distributions**: Such as binomial, hypergeometric, Poisson, and geometric distributions, have specific formulas.
- **Continuous distributions**: Such as normal, uniform, and exponential distributions, often require specific formulas or integration to calculate the standard deviation.
- **Sample data**: For unknown distributions, the standard deviation is calculated based on data points and their mean.

Understanding these calculation methods allows for more accurate analysis of data characteristics in both scientific research and practical applications.
