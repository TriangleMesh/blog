<p>Modern and contemporary philosophy often centers on critique and logic, separating the self from the world. The self is extracted from its original web of relationships, transforming into an isolated entity. While this division grants philosophy clarity, it also ushers in profound human disconnection from meaning and belonging. Rootless and unanchored, anxiety emerges. Through layers of logical deduction and reflection, the existence of the self appears increasingly suspended and fragile.</p>
<p>But if the self were to completely sever ties with belonging, could it still persist? Or, more precisely, would this &ldquo;existing&rdquo; self still resemble the self we recognize? I propose two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Belonging and self may be co-dependent concepts.</strong> Without belonging, the self might collapse, reduced to a mere abstract construct.</li>
<li><strong>The self might still exist but as an unfamiliar form of existence.</strong> This form may only be conceivable in the realm of imagination.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current self seems to hover between &ldquo;being&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-being.&rdquo; It can simultaneously be and not be, yet neither state fully encapsulates its essence. Binary opposition is merely one lens through which to observe it, not the whole picture. The limitations of language make it difficult to accurately describe this state. It is an existence that oscillates between &ldquo;being&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-being,&rdquo; transcending the binary framework. It is not either-or but a special state encompassing the potential for both.</p>
<p>This is a proposition of a void-like world. Through mental imagination, we may touch this world, but our bodies remain anchored in the sensory reality. Indeed, as science advances, we are progressively &ldquo;disenchanting&rdquo; the sensory world. For example, we now understand that seeing is not necessarily believing, as human vision itself is inherently limited. This awakening also explains why modern philosophy is often accompanied by a disdain for the physical body.</p>
<p>Yet, in the present moment of bodily existence, perhaps precisely because the body is inescapable, we must accept and respect it. Trusting our feelings and meeting the basic needs of the body might be a pragmatic approach for ordinary individuals facing the body’s limitations. This choice may not be noble, but it offers a path away from excessive anxiety. In the real world, learning to reconcile with our limitations might be the key to living more peacefully with ourselves.</p>
